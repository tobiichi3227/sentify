This project focuses on analyzing the sentiment of news articles to predict stock trends. It features a Flask-based web application designed to provide real-time financial data analysis and sentiment tracking.

- **Input**: Users can enter a company name or ticker symbol to retrieve relevant news articles.
- **Process**: Each news article is analyzed for sentiment, with scores generated to gauge the article's impact on stock trends.
- **Output**: The application delivers actionable insights and confidence indices based on the sentiment analysis, helping investors make informed decisions about their investments.

## Usage

To serve the Flask app locally, run:
```
python src/main.py
```

## Configuration

To configure the application, update the `config.py` file in the `src/config` directory. Key parameters include:
```
TOP_COMPANIES_COUNT = 10000
TIMESTAMP_FORMAT = "%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ"
UTC_DIFFERENCE = 8
NEWS_LOOKBACK_DAYS = 1
CPU_COUNT = 2
```

- `TOP_COMPANIES_COUNT`: The number of top companies ranked by market cap to search.
- `TIMESTAMP_FORMAT`: The format for timestamps used in the application, especially for the news API.
